# Cubism
A simple, colorful, fun and (slightly) useful visualizer for your music in iTunes.

## System Requirements
- Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) or later
- iTunes

*__Note__: Sadly in OS X Sierra and later, Cubism (and it appears all third party visualizers) are no longer supported in iTunes. I'll keep an eye out for a fix or way forward but in the meantime, Cubism is no longer actively supported or developed. Thanks to everyone who enjoyed and supported it while it lasted.*

## To Install
1. Quit iTunes if it is running
2. Copy Cubism to ~/Library/Compositions/

## To Use Cubism
1. Open iTunes
2. Start playing some music
3. In the menu bar go to View > Visualizer and choose Cubism from the list of visualizers
4. Go to View > Show Visualizer

## While Using Cubism
- The colored cubes represent the sound levels with bass on the left and treble on the right.
- The artwork cube in the center of colored cubes visually displays the time remaining in the current track moving from left to right as the song progresses.

## Version History
### Version 1.2.1 - February 6, 2019
- Removes .dmg in favor of smaller .zip.

### Version 1.2 - August 13, 2012
- Fixes issues that caused track information not to display when changing tracks.
- Moves display of help to the upper right corner.
- Adds hours remaining.
- Currently iTunes ignores user input while the visualizer is displayed; therefore, the `h` and `i` keys do not work to display help and information (track information still displays when a track is paused and while changing tracks).

- Fixes a misspelling in the track info.

### Version 1.1 - January 8, 2011
- Moves track position and time remaining to the track information, accessible by pressing the `i` key.

## Thank You
To Michael Briscoe for getting me into Quartz Composer in the first place and teaching me how to use it, my friends (especially Jay Hutcheson) for helping figure out what to do next, Laura Walker for being patient as I troubleshoot problems, Apple for giving me such an amazing tool to build it with and the assistance, ideas and feedback from users.
